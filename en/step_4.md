### If the code of behaviour is not adhered to

Breaking the code of behaviour is not acceptable. If a volunteer in your club behaves inappropriately and/or breaks the code of behaviour, action will have to be taken by the club organiser, or in the case of the club organiser breaking code of behaviour, by another volunteer.

Some actions that can be taken:

* A verbal warning
* A formal written warning, to which any further indiscretions will lead to suspension from the club or to ending their role as a Volunteer of the club.
* Suspension of the Volunteer from the club
* Banning the Volunteer from participating in further activities in the club

If the club is unsure of the action to take they can ask for support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation
