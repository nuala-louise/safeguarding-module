## Abuse & Disclosures

While it is very uncommon that clubs will encounter serious child safeguarding issues due to the short periods of time spent at the club, it is important that volunteers are aware of what to do when they become aware of abuse either through observation or through a child telling you (disclosure) about abuse. As most Raspberry Pi Foundation clubs create an environment in which many young people feel particularly comfortable, disclosures are possible.

Child abuse is generally categorised as neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse. Other aspects of these to be aware of include peer abuse, organised abuse and online abuse.

### Types of abuse: Neglect

Neglect can normally be defined in terms of an omission, where a child suffers significant harm or impairment of development by being deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, intellectual stimulation, supervision and safety, attachment to and affection from adults, and/or medical care.r

### Types of abuse: Physical abuse

Physical abuse of a child is that which results in actual or potential physical harm from an interaction, or lack of interaction, which is reasonably within the control of a parent or person in a position of responsibility, power or trust. There may be single or repeated incidents.  

Physical abuse can involve:

* Severe physical punishment
* Beating, slapping, hitting or kicking
* Pushing, shaking or throwing
* Terrorising with threats

### Types of abuse: Emotional Abuse

Emotional abuse is normally to be found in the relationship between a parent/caregiver and a child rather than in a specific event or pattern of events. It occurs when a childâ€™s needs for affection, approval, consistency and security are not met. It is rarely manifested in terms of physical symptoms.

For example:

* Persistent criticism
* Sarcasm or hostility
* Emotional unavailability
* Use of unreasonable or harsh disciplinary measures

### Types of abuse: Sexual Abuse

Sexual abuse occurs when a child is used by another person for his/her gratification or sexual arousal, or for that of others. This doesn't have to be physical contact and it can happen online.
Sometimes the child won't understand that what's happening to them is abuse. They may not even understand that it's wrong.
