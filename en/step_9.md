## What to do if…

If you have a concern about a young person, or if a young person discloses abuse to you, it is important to be prepared and as a club to have a reporting procedure. Your reporting procedure may be linked to the venue you operate from.

In this section, there are tips, sample scenarios, and sample reporting procedures for your club. We would recommend that you talk about these with your fellow volunteers.

If you have any doubts, you can fill out our [online safeguarding form to get advice and support](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/safeguarding-concern-form){:target='_blank_'}

### What to do if a child discloses abuse to you

1. React calmly: a serious reaction may alarm the young person and compound feelings of anxiety and guilt.
1. Listen carefully and attentively, and take the young person seriously.
1. Reassure the young person that they have taken the right action in telling you.
1. Do not make false promises (particularly regarding secrecy). 
1. Explain that if what they are going to tell you is serious, then you will have to tell another person.
1. Do not ask the young person to repeat the story unnecessarily.
1. Ask questions only for the purpose of clarification and be supportive, but do not ask leading questions or seek intimate details beyond those volunteered by the child.
1. Check with the young person to ensure that what has been heard and understood by you is accurate.
1. Do not express any opinions about the alleged abuse or abuser.
