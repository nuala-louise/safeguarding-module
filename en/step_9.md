## What to do if…

If you have a concern about a young person or if a young person discloses abuse to you, it is important to be prepared and as a club to have a reporting procedure. Your reporting procedure may be linked to the venue you operate out of.

In this next section we will give you some tips, sample scenarios and sample reporting procedures for your club. We would recommend that you talk about these with your fellow volunteers.

If you have any doubts then you can fill out our [online safeguarding form to get advice and support](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/safeguarding-concern-form){:target='_blank'}
