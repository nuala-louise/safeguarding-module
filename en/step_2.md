## Recruitment process

Typically, it is the club organiser's responsibility to recruit and onboard new volunteers. From time to time, volunteers may be involved in this process to help the club organiser, in particular to help guide the new volunteer in their first session.

It is important to recognise that not every volunteer who is interested in helping out at your club may be appropriate or a match.

A recruitment process makes it easier to identify volunteers who are not a fit for the club.

### 1. Volunteer description


This is a short description to tell potential volunteers what the role involves and to give a broad overview of your club. This could be a brief description on your website or club profile of what a volunteer in your club does. It should include:

* What happens in a typical session?
* How often does your club run and for how long?
* How much time do you require from your volunteers? 

### 2. Application form

This can just be an online form with a few short questions. You should ask for a referee if possible and any relevant skills that may be useful in your club. Information from the application form, such as contact information, will be useful should this potential volunteer join the club.

**Note**: If you are in a Code Club or CoderDojo, instead of an application form you should encourage potential volunteers to register through our websites ([codeclub.org](https://codeclub.org){:target='_blank'}, [coderdojo.com](https://coderdojo.com){:target='_blank'})

### 3. Informal meeting or interview

Invite the person to the club so you can meet with them and so they can learn more about the club environment. If your club is running activities online, then you can meet remotely. It should be a casual meeting, but it should give the current club volunteers and the potential volunteer the chance to both decide if they want the potential volunteer to go ahead with volunteering or not. This will also allow current club volunteers and the potential volunteer to see if they can work together well in the club setting. If you are starting your club for the first time, you should set up an informal meeting with your potential volunteer before your first session.

### 4. Background checking (dependent on region)


Background checking is useful for voluntary coding clubs and in some regions it is mandatory to work as a volunteer with young people. We understand that in some regions it is more difficult to access background checking or that it may be expensive, so that is why reference checking and utilising the rest of the volunteer recruitment process is important.

### 5. Referees (optional)

Asking for referees and checking with those referees can be really useful to determine if a volunteer is suitable to work with young people and/or vulnerable adults. 

If you have your own application form, you could use this as a space to ask for details of referees. If you haven’t collected referees in the application form, you can ask for them after the informal meeting. The referees can be a colleague, teacher or lecturer, or a friend who knows the potential volunteer well. Many volunteers can be referred to the club by another existing club volunteer, this person can also act as a referee.

**Tip**: When you check references, it is often best to phone the referee as people will be more inclined to give a more honest perspective than in writing.
