## Recruitment Process

Typically, the club organiser has the responsibility of recruiting and onboarding new volunteers. From time to time, volunteers may be involved in this process to help the club organiser, in particular to help guide the new volunteer in their first session.

Often clubs can experience challenges when recruiting volunteers, but it is important to note that not every volunteer who is interested in helping out at your club may be appropriate or a match.

By following a recruitment process it makes it easier to say no to volunteers who are not a fit for the club.

title: 1. Volunteer description
---

This is a short description to make it clear to potential volunteers what the role they are interested in is and a broad overview of what your club does. This could be a brief description on your website or club profile of what a volunteer in your club does. It should include:

* What you may be doing at a typical session
* How often does your club run and for how long?
* How much time do they require?

title: 2. Application form
---

This can just be an online form with a few short questions. You should ask for a referee if possible and any relevant skills that may be useful in your club. Information from the application form, such as contact information, will be useful should this potential volunteer join the club.

If you are in a Code Club or CoderDojo, instead of an application form you should encourage potential volunteers to register through our website ([codeclub.org](https://codeclub.org), [coderdojo.com](https://coderdojo.com))

title: 3. Informal meeting/interview
---

Invite the person to the club so you can meet with them and so they can learn more about the club environment. If your club is running activities online, then you can meet remotely. It should be a casual meeting but it should give both the current club volunteers and the potential volunteer and the chance to decide if they want to go ahead with volunteering or not. This will also allow you to both see if you can work together well in the club setting. If you are starting your club for the first time, you should set up an informal meeting with your potential volunteer before your first session.

title: 4. Background Checking (dependent on region)
---

Background checking is useful for voluntary coding clubs and in some regions it is mandatory to work as a volunteer with young people. We understand that in some regions it is more difficult to access background checking or that it may be expensive so that is why reference checking and utilising the rest of the volunteer recruitment process is important.

title: 5. Referees (Optional)
---

Asking for referees and checking with those referees can be really useful to determine if a volunteer is suitable to work with young people and/or vulnerable adults. 

If you have your own application form, you could use this as a space to ask for details of referees. If you haven’t collected referees in the application form you can ask for them after the informal meeting. The referees can be a colleague, teacher/lecturer or a friend who knows you well. Many volunteers can be referred to the club by another existing club volunteer, this person can also act a referee.

When checking references it is often best to phone the referee as people will be more inclined to give a more honest perspective than in writing.

title: 6. Training Identification  
---

If your volunteers would like some further training or support, you can direct them to the [free online courses](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi) that are provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. 

If you have several volunteers in your club, you could also arrange some sessions between yourselves to share knowledge and try out new programmes and projects together. This will help increase the confidence of your volunteers on what they are covering in the club.

title: 7. Selection
---

Does the new volunteer seem like a good fit for your club? Get in touch with them and let them know when your next session is to see if they can attend. If you are just starting your club for the first time, maybe consider having an informal meeting with all your volunteers to create a plan for your first session.
If there is a red flag during the recruitment process of the volunteer you may want to tell them that they are not a good fit. If you are unsure, you can get in touch with the Raspberry Pi Foundation for advice.

title: 8. First club Buddy  
---

Congratulations! You have successfully recruited a new volunteer for your club. For their first session, remember they will need some help learning the ropes and getting to know the children. If you have several volunteers at your club, try to pair them up with an experienced volunteer. We wouldn’t advise making new volunteers run a session on their first club as it may be intimidating or scary as a newbie, you can plan and run the session together and learn from each other.
