## Recording details of abuse

When recording a report for either your club organiser or to external organisations, it is important to ensure you are recording facts and observations as opposed to an evaluation or opinion.

An observation is something you can see, smell, touch, or hear. An evaluation is what you think about what you saw, smelt, touched or heard.
