[Code of behaviour for young people attending online sessions](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/clubs/CoderDojo_Code_Club_Online_Code_of_Behaviour_A4_DIGITAL.pdf)

Read through these guides and answer the following three questions 

How many adults should be present during an online session? (At least two)
Is it OK to use webcams during the online session? (Yes, but make sure everyone at home knows they are prohibited from recording or taking screenshots of the session)
Do you need to make sure that every young person has a parent's or guardian's consent before attending an online session?
