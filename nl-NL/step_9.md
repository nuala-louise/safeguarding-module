## Wat te doen als…?

Als je je zorgen maakt over een jongere, of als een jongere misbruik aan je onthult, is het belangrijk om voorbereid te zijn. Je club moet een meldprocedure hebben (deze kan gekoppeld zijn aan de locatie van waaruit je opereert).

In dit gedeelte vind je tips, voorbeeldscenario's en voorbeeldrapportageprocedures voor jouw club. We raden je aan om hierover met je vrijwilligers te praten.

Als je twijfels hebt, kun je ons [online beschermingsformulier invullen voor advies en ondersteuning](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/safeguarding-concern-form){:target='_blank'}.

### What to do if a young person discloses abuse to you?

1. Reassure the young person that they have taken the right action in talking to you.
